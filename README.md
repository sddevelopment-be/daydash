A modular resource and time management tool, aimed at offering a customizable dashboard to keep track of your goals, progress and resource usage.

## Goal

Most of all, this project is a revamped version of an older attempt at writing a nice structured,
extensible project-setup. The intent is to practise a few design and coding techniques in an actual use case.

See the [./docs/DEV_LOG](src/main/docs/operational/DEV_LOG.md) file to keep track of how I approached this process.
