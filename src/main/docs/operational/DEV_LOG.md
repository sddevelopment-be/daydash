# DEVELOPER LOG

## Outline:

- set-up project basis
- define application layers (as needed)
- refine documentation

## Phase 1: Project Set-Up

- before writing any production code, make sure the structure and outline are well-defined
    - [x] Set-up CI pipeline
        - [x] Test runners
        - [X] Sonar interaction
    - [x] Set up project structure
        - [x] Minimal documentation structure
        - [x] Minimal project design
    - [x] First push

## Phase 2:

- [x] Add basic domain
- [ ] Illustrate dependency inversion by defining a repository interface
    - [ ] Implement stub repo in core domain
